A bot inspired by [Licensy](https://github.com/albertopoljak/Licensy/blob/master/README.md).

Licensy (Python) was archived, therefore I'm making a more up-to-date version in Javascript.

I will not be hosting the bot but I will make it easy for others to do so themselves.

This has been designed with developers in mind. If you plan on contributing, please make sure to use the .prettierrc file.
This has also been designed with users in mind. This should be easy to host and contains CLI configuration technology.

## Features:

- Choice between JSON or MongoDB (JSON should be used for development only)
- Licensing a role to users for X amount of time.
- Quickstart Configuration Manager
- Single Guild Use (at 10 ‚≠ê's will be for multi-guild-use)!
- Slash Commands
  - (may include feature later between slash commands and prefix commands.)
- And (possibly) many more!

This is not designed to be a 1 to 1 copy of Licensy, but it likely could be as its inspired by the bot itself.

## Setup:

Install the [Node.js runtime](https://nodejs.org/en). At the time making this, I'm using NodeJS v22.13.0 and NPM v10.9.2. (node -v, npm -v)

In the command line, run the following commands:

`npm i`

`node .`

This should put you in a configuration state. Follow the instructions on the screen and fill out the values. If you're having troubles, feel free to
use ChatGPT or make an issue if ChatGPT didn't help.
